//! The configuration round-trip, compiled to a wasm package.
//!
//! Two source formats are supported, the same two the CLI reads and writes: the
//! native `glove80.toml`, which describes the whole managed runtime state, and
//! the MoErgo Layout Editor's JSON backup, which describes only a keymap.
//!
//! A browser configurator holds live device state as `rynk` protocol types; a
//! source file speaks in effect names, keycode mnemonics and colour strings.
//! This package is the bridge, and it is deliberately thin: every rule about
//! the file format lives in `moergo-config`, which is exactly the code the
//! `moergo-control` CLI runs, so the two hosts cannot disagree about what a
//! file means.
//!
//! The format is MoErgo-specific, not generic Rynk. `moergo-config` carries
//! the 6x14 matrix and the four physical holes at r0c5, r0c8, r5c5 and r5c8; a
//! different Rynk board needs a different schema, not a different catalog.
//!
//! Native targets compile an empty crate. Build with
//! `wasm-pack build --release --target web`.
