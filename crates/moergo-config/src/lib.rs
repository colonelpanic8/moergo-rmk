//! The pure host-side model of managed Rynk runtime state: the TOML schema, its
//! validation, the conversions to and from the protocol's wire types, and the
//! difference report a host uses to decide what to write.
//!
//! Both the `moergo-control` CLI and the browser configurator work against the
//! same model, so it deliberately performs no I/O of any kind — no filesystem,
//! no transport, no `rynk::Client`. Everything here is a function of values the
//! caller already holds, which is what lets the crate compile to
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
