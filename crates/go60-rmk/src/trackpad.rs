//! The Go60's Cirque Pinnacle trackpad, one per half.
//!
//! Wiring and configuration are transcribed from MoErgo's official
//! `moergo-sc/zmk` Go60 board definitions: the pad sits on SPI1
//! (SCK P0.19 / MISO P0.21 / MOSI P0.22 at 1 MHz) with chip select on
//! P0.25 and the data-ready line on P0.23 (active high, pull-down), and
//! runs with 1x sensitivity, hardware 90° rotation, Y inversion, and the
//! secondary tap enabled. Both halves are wired identically; the
//! peripheral's events reach the central over the split link.
//!
//! The two pads are told apart by their RMK pointing-device id, and each
//! gets its own [`PointingProcessor`] so they can behave differently. What
//! they actually do is not decided here: RMK holds the configuration, a
//! host writes it over Rynk, and storage carries it across reboots.
